/**
 * Event upcaster that adds the SKU field to ProductCreated events that don't have one.
 *
 * This upcaster is part of the event sourcing schema evolution strategy. It intercepts
 * old ProductCreated events during deserialization and adds a SKU field using the
 * SkuLookupService's multi-strategy fallback approach.
 *
 * The upcaster is transparent to the aggregate - the Product aggregate always sees
 * ProductCreated events with a SKU field, regardless of whether the event was created
 * before or after the SKU field was added.
 *
 * Strategy:
 * 1. Check if event is ProductCreated and doesn't have a SKU field
 * 2. Extract product ID and name from the event
 * 3. Use SkuLookupService to get SKU (CSV lookup -> name-based -> ID-based)
 * 4. Add SKU field to the event
 *
 * @see SkuLookupService for details on SKU lookup strategies
